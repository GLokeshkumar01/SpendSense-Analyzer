# SpendSense Analyzer

SpendSense Analyzer is a lightweight Python application designed to record daily expenses and generate meaningful spending insights. The project uses simple file-based storage (`expenses.txt`) and provides users with category-wise summaries, total spending calculations, and spending projections. It is built with clean, modular Python code that demonstrates practical use of file handling, data processing, and user-interactions through a console-based interface.

## Features

* Add and store expenses by category and amount
* Automatic creation and handling of `expenses.txt`
* Category-wise spending breakdown
* Identification of highest spending category
* Total, daily average, weekly estimate, and monthly projection
* Input validation for accurate data entries
* Structured and readable menu-driven workflow

## Project Structure

```

├── analyzer.py        # Main script containing program logic
├── expenses.txt       # Text-based data storage
└── README.md          # Documentation
```

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the application:

```
python analyzer.py
```

## How It Works

* Expense entries are stored in `expenses.txt` in a simple CSV-like format.
* The program reads and processes these entries to compute totals and category summaries.
* Insights such as averages and spending projections help users understand their patterns.

## Skills Demonstrated

* Python file handling (read, write, append)
* Data parsing and aggregation
* Error handling and input validation
* Modular function-based design
* Clean and maintainable coding practices
